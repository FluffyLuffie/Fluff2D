***Things to add/fix***
[Make it so that it has default values] Adding new keyvalues to existing keyforms.
[Keyvalues done] Deleting keyvalues/keyforms.
Keyform corner synthesizer.
Keyform reflector/duplicator.
Physics.
Saving model for editor.
Right clicking stuff does something.
Japanese translation.
Model exporter.
Bezier for warp transforms.
Save settings in a file and read when launched.
[Very buggy] Moving model object hierarchy by dragging.

***If have time***
Changing rotation deformer origin in warp deformers is a bit off.
[Concave corners a bit weird but otherwise fine] Moving points inside warp deformers.
More blending modes?
Multiple model windows?
Make psd importer more reliable.
Code documentation.
Editor and exported file documentation.

***Future plans***
Ways to make moving vertices easier. (totally not copying from other software)
Update textures and adding new parts with psd.
Make file explorer use OS's file explorer.
Other language translations.
Option to lock UI.
Compute shader?

***Values affected by parameters***
*All parts*
Position (vec2)
Rotation (float)
Scale (vec2)
*Mesh and Warp deformers*
Vertex positions(int, vec2)
*Mesh*
Render order (int)
Color (vec4)
