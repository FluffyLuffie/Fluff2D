***Things to add/fix***
[Add changing root position] Rotation deformers.
[Concave corners a bit weird but otherwise fine] Moving points inside warp deformers.
[Done] Clicking on meshes selects them
Parameters actually do something.
Physics.
Saving model for editor.
Right clicking stuff does something.
Auto vertices placer.
Japanese translation.
Model exporter.
Model view window/tab instead of rending to main frame.

***If have time***
[Done] Inverse clipping.
Save settings in a file and read when launched.
[good enough]Moving model object hierarchy by dragging.
Make psd importer more reliable.
Clean up fragment shader code.
Code documentation.
Editor and exported file documentation.

***Future plans***
Ways to make moving vertices easier. (totally not copying from other software)
Update textures and adding new parts with psd.
Make file explorer use OS's file explorer.
Other language translations.
Option to lock UI.
Compute shader

***Values affected by parameters***
*All*
Position (vec2)
Rotation (float)
Scale (vec2)
*Mesh and Warp*
Vertex positions(int, vec2)
*Mesh*
Render order (int)
Color (vec4)

***Brain dump***
How to implement the parameters thingy.
Each keyform stores the value.
For each keyform, recursively add up all the values and then take average.
For example, add up p[0][0][0] + p[0][0][1] + p[0][1][0] + ...
If value on keyform, count as 1 combination.
If value between 2 keyforms, count it as 2 combinations.
